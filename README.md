A repo that emulates an automated car-parking scenario. Written in Python.

### What to install
Before we can open for business, you need to install the below in your system.
* Download the latest version of python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Download and install git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Steps to run:

1. Open a terminal window and clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/yuvraj2112/iParking.git`
2. In your terminal, point to the newly cloned folder: `cd iParking`
3. Let's set up a virtual environment to use python3 more conveniently.
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
4. Let's install all the libraries we will require: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. If you have any command files at this point, add them to the data folder.
6. Remember the name of the command file you want to run and type: `python iParking.py data/<file_name>.txt`. Replace `<file_name>` with the name of your file.
7. If you want to run the test cases added: `python test.py`
